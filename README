xdisp  Copyright (c) Bruce Pike, 1993-2000
-------------------------------------------

xdisp is an image display tool for X window systems.  It was written
using basic Xlib calls (to make it easy to port to any X system) and
has since had some (optional) EZwgl (Xlib based widgets) stuff added. 

Try xdisp or xdisp -help for basic help information.

Note that this program uses some old style X11 fonts,  which might be missing
on your modern Ubuntu installation,  to fix the problem try installing 
xfonts-75dpi xfonts-100dpi  and restart X11


CMake building instructions:
--------------
run cmake,  specify location of libminc 
done


Old building instructions :
--------------

Normally all you have to do is type

 	make PLATFORM=xxx

where xxx is LINUX, SUNOS, IRIX or MACOSX.

Alternatively the PLATFORM variable in the Makefile can be directly 
set to LINUX, IRIX, SUNOS or MACOSX.

The INSTALL_BIN_DIR and INSTALL_MAN_DIR installation destinations 
in the Makefile may also need changing depending upon your system.

Further details on building xdisp can be found in the Makefile header.
