xdisp  	Copyright (c) Bruce Pike, 1993-2000
-------------------------------------------

xdisp is an image display tool for X window systems.  It was written
using basic Xlib calls (to make it easy to port to any X system) and
has since had some (optional) EZwgl (Xlib based widgets) stuff added. 

Try xdisp or xdisp -help for basic help information.


Building xdisp
--------------

Normally all you have to do is type

 	make PLATFORM=xxx

where xxx is LINUX, SUNOS, IRIX or MACOSX.

Alternatively the PLATFORM variable in the Makefile can be directly 
set to LINUX, IRIX, SUNOS or MACOSX.

The INSTALL_BIN_DIR and INSTALL_MAN_DIR installation destinations 
in the Makefile may also need changing depending upon your system.

Further details on building xdisp can be found in the Makefile header.
